# Generic Data Structures and Algorithms in Go by Richard Wiener
 978-1-4842-8190-1
Advance your understanding of generic data structures and algorithms and their applications using Go and the effective use of concurrency. You are invited on a journey that aims to improve your programming and problem-solving skills. This book takes you to the next step by showing how to get your programs to work efficiently as well as correctly. 

As you explore many data structures and the algorithms and applications associated with them, you'll focus on the trade-offs between speed and storage and the benefits of deploying concurrency when appropriate. This book will demonstrate the huge increases in application performance that are possible. The presentation of classic data structures and techniques of algorithm design (greedy, divide and conquer, branch-and-bound to name a few) provides an essential foundation and toolkit for problem solving. But this book goes further by presenting heuristic algorithms and their implementations for solving computationally intractable combinatoric optimization problems such as the travelling salesperson problem. Simulated annealing and genetic algorithms are among the techniques used.

The consistent style of coding used throughout this book exploits Goâ€™s ability to implement abstract, generic and constrained generic data types without the use of classes.  Although some familiarity with Go is assumed, this book should advance your ability to use Go to tackle server-side applications, games, machine learning, information retrieval and other application domains where speed and storage efficiency is essential.

You will:
Explore classical data structures and algorithms aimed at making your applications run faster or require less storage
Use the new generic features of Go to build reusable data structures
Utilize concurrency for maximizing application performance
See the power of heuristic algorithms for computationally intractable problems
Enhance and improve your Go programming skills
